ML algorithm: Decision Trees, Dataset: Weather

Run "Bias Creator.py" First (set global variables at the top to change settings):
	Bias files will be created.
	A "control_file.csv" file will also be created for 0% bias
	"Test_list.csv" is the list that is used as the test data
	"percentages.csv" keep track of the bias percentages per bias file

Run "machine learning algorithm.py"
	outputs the accuracy percentages
	creates an image of the decision tree
